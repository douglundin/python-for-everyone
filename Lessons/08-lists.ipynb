    "\n",
    "## Lists are mutable\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for accessing the elements of a list is the same as for\n",
    "accessing the characters of a string: the bracket operator. The\n",
    "expression inside the brackets specifies the index. Remember that the\n",

    "the list that will be assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> numbers = [17, 123]\n",
    ">>> numbers[1] = 5\n",
    ">>> print(numbers)\n",
    "[17, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The one-th element of `numbers`, which used to be 123, is now 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of a list as a relationship between indices and elements.\n",
    "This relationship is called a *mapping*; each index “maps to” one of the\n",

    "## Traversing a list\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common way to traverse the elements of a list is with a `for`\n",
    "loop. The syntax is the same as for strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "for cheese in cheeses:\n",
    "    print(cheese)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This works well if you only need to read the elements of the list. But\n",
    "if you want to write or update the elements, you need the indices. A\n",
    "common way to do that is to combine the functions `range` and `len`:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "for i in range(len(numbers)):\n",
    "    numbers[i] = numbers[i] * 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This loop traverses the list and updates each element. `len` returns the\n",
    "number of elements in the list. `range` returns a list of indices from 0\n",
    "to $n-1$, where $n$ is the length of the list. Each time through the\n",
    "loop, `i` gets the index of the next element. The assignment statement\n",
    "in the body uses `i` to read the old value of the element and to assign\n",
    "the new value.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `for` loop over an empty list never executes the body:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "for x in empty:\n",
    "    print('This never happens.')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Although a list can contain another list, the nested list still counts\n",
    "as a single element. The length of this list is four:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "['spam', 1, ['Brie', 'Roquefort', 'Pol le Veq'], [1, 2, 3]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## List operations\n",
    "\n",
    "The `+` operator concatenates lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    ">>> b = [4, 5, 6]\n",
    ">>> c = a + b\n",
    ">>> print(c)\n",
    "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the `*` operator repeats a list a given number of times:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> [0] * 4\n",
    "[0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    ">>> [1, 2, 3] * 3\n",
    "[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first example repeats four times. The second example repeats the\n",
    "list three times.\n",
    "\n",
    "## List slices\n",
    "\n",
    "The slice operator also works on lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']\n",
    ">>> t[1:3]\n",
    "['b', 'c']\n",
    ">>> t[:4]\n",
    "['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']\n",
    ">>> t[3:]\n",
    "['d', 'e', 'f']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you omit the first index, the slice starts at the beginning. If you\n",
    "omit the second, the slice goes to the end. So if you omit both, the\n",
    "slice is a copy of the whole list.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> t[:]\n",
    "['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since lists are mutable, it is often useful to make a copy before\n",
    "performing operations that fold, spindle, or mutilate lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "A slice operator on the left side of an assignment can update multiple\n",
    "elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']\n",
    ">>> t[1:3] = ['x', 'y']\n",
    ">>> print(t)\n",
    "['a', 'x', 'y', 'd', 'e', 'f']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## List methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides methods that operate on lists. For example, `append`\n",
    "adds a new element to the end of a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n",
    ">>> t.append('d')\n",
    ">>> print(t)\n",
    "['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`extend` takes a list as an argument and appends all of the elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> t1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n",
    ">>> t2 = ['d', 'e']\n",
    ">>> t1.extend(t2)\n",
    ">>> print(t1)\n",
    "['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This example leaves `t2` unmodified.\n",
    "\n",
    "`sort` arranges the elements of the list from low to high:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> t = ['d', 'c', 'e', 'b', 'a']\n",
    ">>> t.sort()\n",
    ">>> print(t)\n",
    "['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Most list methods are void; they modify the list and return `None`. If\n",
    "you accidentally write `t = t.sort()`, you will be disappointed with the\n",
    "result.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deleting elements\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to delete elements from a list. If you know the\n",
    "index of the element you want, you can use `pop`:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n",
    ">>> x = t.pop(1)\n",
    ">>> print(t)\n",
    "['a', 'c']\n",
    ">>> print(x)\n",
    "b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`pop` modifies the list and returns the element that was removed. If you\n",
    "don’t provide an index, it deletes and returns the last element.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don’t need the removed value, you can use the `del` statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n",
    ">>> del t[1]\n",
    ">>> print(t)\n",
    "['a', 'c']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you know the element you want to remove (but not the index), you can\n",
    "use `remove`:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n",
    ">>> t.remove('b')\n",
    ">>> print(t)\n",
    "['a', 'c']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The return value from `remove` is `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To remove more than one element, you can use `del` with a slice index:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']\n",
    ">>> del t[1:5]\n",
    ">>> print(t)\n",
    "['a', 'f']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, the slice selects all the elements up to, but not including,\n",
    "the second index.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lists and functions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of built-in functions that can be used on lists that\n",
    "allow you to quickly look through a list without writing your own loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> nums = [3, 41, 12, 9, 74, 15]\n",
    ">>> print(len(nums))\n",
    "6\n",
    ">>> print(max(nums))\n",
    "74\n",
    ">>> print(min(nums))\n",
    "3\n",
    ">>> print(sum(nums))\n",
    "154\n",
    ">>> print(sum(nums)/len(nums))\n",
    "25\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sum()` function only works when the list elements are numbers. The\n",
    "other functions (`max()`, `len()`, etc.) work with lists of strings and\n",
    "other types that can be comparable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could rewrite an earlier program that computed the average of a list\n",
    "of numbers entered by the user using a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the program to compute an average without a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this program, we have `count` and `total` variables to keep the\n",
    "number and running total of the user’s numbers as we repeatedly prompt\n",
    "the user for a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could simply remember each number as the user entered it and use\n",
    "built-in functions to compute the sum and count at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "We make an empty list before the loop starts, and then each time we have\n",
    "a number, we append it to the list. At the end of the program, we simply\n",
    "compute the sum of the numbers in the list and divide it by the count of\n",
    "the numbers in the list to come up with the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lists and strings\n",
    "\n",
    "A string is a sequence of characters and a list is a sequence of values,\n",
    "but a list of characters is not the same as a string. To convert from a\n",
    "string to a list of characters, you can use `list`:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> s = 'spam'\n",
    ">>> t = list(s)\n",
    ">>> print(t)\n",
    "['s', 'p', 'a', 'm']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because `list` is the name of a built-in function, you should avoid\n",
    "using it as a variable name. I also avoid the letter “l” because it\n",
    "looks too much like the number “1”. So that’s why I use “t”.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `list` function breaks a string into individual letters. If you want\n",
    "to break a string into words, you can use the `split` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> s = 'pining for the fjords'\n",
    ">>> t = s.split()\n",
    ">>> print(t)\n",
    "['pining', 'for', 'the', 'fjords']\n",
    ">>> print(t[2])\n",
    "the\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have used `split` to break the string into a list of words, you\n",
    "can use the index operator (square bracket) to look at a particular word\n",
    "in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can call `split` with an optional argument called a *delimiter* that\n",
    "specifies which characters to use as word boundaries. The following\n",
    "example uses a hyphen as a delimiter:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> s = 'spam-spam-spam'\n",
    ">>> delimiter = '-'\n",
    ">>> s.split(delimiter)\n",
    "['spam', 'spam', 'spam']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`join` is the inverse of `split`. It takes a list of strings and\n",
    "concatenates the elements. `join` is a string method, so you have to\n",
    "invoke it on the delimiter and pass the list as a parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> t = ['pining', 'for', 'the', 'fjords']\n",
    ">>> delimiter = ' '\n",
    ">>> delimiter.join(t)\n",
    "'pining for the fjords'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the delimiter is a space character, so `join` puts a space\n",
    "between words. To concatenate strings without spaces, you can use the\n",
    "empty string, ““, as a delimiter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parsing lines\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually when we are reading a file we want to do something to the lines\n",
    "other than just printing the whole line. Often we want to find the\n",
    "“interesting lines” and then *parse* the line to find some interesting\n",
    "*part* of the line. What if we wanted to print out the day of the week\n",
    "from those lines that start with “From”?\n",
    "\n",
    "    From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008\n",
    "\n",
    "The `split` method is very effective when faced with this kind of\n",
    "problem. We can write a small program that looks for lines where the\n",
    "line starts with “From”, `split` those lines, and then print out the\n",
    "third word in the line:\n",
    "\n",
    "The program produces the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sat\n",
    "    Fri\n",
    "    Fri\n",
    "    Fri\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, we will learn increasingly sophisticated techniques for picking\n",
    "the lines to work on and how we pull those lines apart to find the exact\n",
    "bit of information we are looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objects and values\n",
    "\n",
    "If we execute these assignment statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "a = 'banana'\n",
    "b = 'banana'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "we know that `a` and `b` both refer to a string, but we don’t know\n",
    "whether they refer to the *same* string. There are two possible states:\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"image placeholder\"\n",
    "original-image-src=\"height=0.5in@../images/list1\"\n",
    "original-image-title=\"fig:\">Variables and Objects</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "In one case, `a` and `b` refer to two different objects that have the\n",
    "same value. In the second case, they refer to the same object.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether two variables refer to the same object, you can use the\n",
    "`is` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> a = 'banana'\n",
    ">>> b = 'banana'\n",
    ">>> a is b\n",
    "True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, Python only created one string object, and both `a` and\n",
    "`b` refer to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "But when you create two lists, you get two objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    ">>> b = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    ">>> a is b\n",
    "False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we would say that the two lists are *equivalent*, because\n",
    "they have the same elements, but not *identical*, because they are not\n",
    "the same object. If two objects are identical, they are also equivalent,\n",
    "but if they are equivalent, they are not necessarily identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now, we have been using “object” and “value” interchangeably, but\n",
    "it is more precise to say that an object has a value. If you execute\n",
    "`a = [1,2,3]`, `a` refers to a list object whose value is a particular\n",
    "sequence of elements. If another list has the same elements, we would\n",
    "say it has the same value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aliasing\n",
    "\n",
    "If `a` refers to an object and you assign `b = a`, then both variables\n",
    "refer to the same object:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    ">>> b = a\n",
    ">>> b is a\n",

    "Although this behavior can be useful, it is error-prone. In general, it\n",
    "is safer to avoid aliasing when you are working with mutable objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "For immutable objects like strings, aliasing is not as much of a\n",
    "problem. In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "a = 'banana'\n",
    "b = 'banana'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "it almost never makes a difference whether `a` and `b` refer to the same\n",
    "string or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "## List arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "When you pass a list to a function, the function gets a reference to the\n",
    "list. If the function modifies a list parameter, the caller sees the\n",
    "change. For example, `delete_head` removes the first element from a\n",
    "list:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "def delete_head(t):\n",
    "    del t[0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how it is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n",
    ">>> delete_head(letters)\n",
    ">>> print(letters)\n",
    "['b', 'c']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter `t` and the variable `letters` are aliases for the same\n",
    "object.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to distinguish between operations that modify lists and\n",
    "operations that create new lists. For example, the `append` method\n",
    "modifies a list, but the `+` operator creates a new list:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> t1 = [1, 2]\n",
    ">>> t2 = t1.append(3)\n",
    ">>> print(t1)\n",
    "[1, 2, 3]\n",
    ">>> print(t2)\n",
    "None\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> t3 = t1 + [3]\n",
    ">>> print(t3)\n",
    "[1, 2, 3]\n",
    ">>> t2 is t3\n",
    "False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This difference is important when you write functions that are supposed\n",
    "to modify lists. For example, this function *does not* delete the head\n",
    "of a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "def bad_delete_head(t):\n",
    "    t = t[1:]              # WRONG!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The slice operator creates a new list and the assignment makes `t` refer\n",
    "to it, but none of that has any effect on the list that was passed as an\n",
    "argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative is to write a function that creates and returns a new\n",
    "list. For example, `tail` returns all but the first element of a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "def tail(t):\n",
    "    return t[1:]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function leaves the original list unmodified. Here’s how it is\n",
    "used:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n",
    ">>> rest = tail(letters)\n",
    ">>> print(rest)\n",
    "['b', 'c']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 1: Write a function called `chop` that takes a list and\n",
    "modifies it, removing the first and last elements, and returns `None`.\n",
    "Then write a function called `middle` that takes a list and returns a\n",
    "new list that contains all but the first and last elements.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Careless use of lists (and other mutable objects) can lead to long hours\n",
    "of debugging. Here are some common pitfalls and ways to avoid them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Don’t forget that most list methods modify the argument and return\n",
    "    `None`. This is the opposite of the string methods, which return a\n",
    "    new string and leave the original alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you are used to writing string code like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` python\n",
    "    word = word.strip()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    It is tempting to write list code like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` python\n",
    "    t = t.sort()           # WRONG!\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Because `sort` returns `None`, the next operation you perform with\n",
    "    `t` is likely to fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Before using list methods and operators, you should read the\n",
    "    documentation carefully and then test them in interactive mode. The\n",
    "    methods and operators that lists share with other sequences (like\n",
    "    strings) are documented at:\n",
    "\n",
    "    [docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#common-sequence-operations](https://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#common-sequence-operations)\n",
    "\n",
    "    The methods and operators that only apply to mutable sequences are\n",
    "    documented at:\n",
    "\n",
    "    [docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#mutable-sequence-types](https://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#mutable-sequence-types)\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Pick an idiom and stick with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Part of the problem with lists is that there are too many ways to do\n",
    "    things. For example, to remove an element from a list, you can use\n",
    "    `pop`, `remove`, `del`, or even a slice assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To add an element, you can use the `append` method or the `+`\n",
    "    operator. But don’t forget that these are right:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` python\n",
    "    t.append(x)\n",
    "    t = t + [x]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    And these are wrong:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` python\n",
    "    t.append([x])          # WRONG!\n",
    "    t = t.append(x)        # WRONG!\n",
    "    t + [x]                # WRONG!\n",
    "    t = t + x              # WRONG!\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Try out each of these examples in interactive mode to make sure you\n",
    "    understand what they do. Notice that only the last one causes a\n",
    "    runtime error; the other three are legal, but they do the wrong\n",
    "    thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Make copies to avoid aliasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you want to use a method like `sort` that modifies the argument,\n",
    "    but you need to keep the original list as well, you can make a copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` python\n",
    "    orig = t[:]\n",
    "    t.sort()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this example you could also use the built-in function `sorted`,\n",
    "    which returns a new, sorted list and leaves the original alone. But\n",
    "    in that case you should avoid using `sorted` as a variable name!\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Lists, `split`, and files\n",
    "\n",
    "    When we read and parse files, there are many opportunities to\n",
    "    encounter input that can crash our program so it is a good idea to\n",
    "    revisit the *guardian* pattern when it comes writing programs that\n",
    "    read through a file and look for a “needle in the haystack”.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Let’s revisit our program that is looking for the day of the week on\n",
    "    the from lines of our file:\n",
    "\n",
    "        From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008\n",
    "\n",
    "    Since we are breaking this line into words, we could dispense with\n",
    "    the use of `startswith` and simply look at the first word of the\n",
    "    line to determine if we are interested in the line at all. We can\n",
    "    use `continue` to skip lines that don’t have “From” as the first\n",
    "    word as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` python\n",
    "    fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')\n",

    "        if words[0] != 'From' : continue\n",
    "        print(words[2])\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    This looks much simpler and we don’t even need to do the `rstrip` to\n",
    "    remove the newline at the end of the file. But is it better?\n",
    "\n",
    "        python search8.py\n",
    "        Sat\n",
    "        Traceback (most recent call last):\n",

    "        IndexError: list index out of range\n",
    "\n",
    "    It kind of works and we see the day from the first line (Sat), but\n",
    "    then the program fails with a traceback error. What went wrong? What\n",
    "    messed-up data caused our elegant, clever, and very Pythonic program\n",
    "    to fail?\n",
    "\n",
    "    You could stare at it for a long time and puzzle through it or ask\n",
    "    someone for help, but the quicker and smarter approach is to add a\n",
    "    `print` statement. The best place to add the print statement is\n",
    "    right before the line where the program failed and print out the\n",
    "    data that seems to be causing the failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Now this approach may generate a lot of lines of output, but at\n",
    "    least you will immediately have some clue as to the problem at hand.\n",
    "    So we add a print of the variable `words` right before line five. We\n",
    "    even add a prefix “Debug:” to the line so we can keep our regular\n",
    "    output separate from our debug output.\n",

    "        print(words[2])\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    When we run the program, a lot of output scrolls off the screen but\n",
    "    at the end, we see our debug output and the traceback so we know\n",

    "\n",
    "    First we commented out the debug print statement instead of removing\n",
    "    it, in case our modification fails and we need to debug again. Then\n",

    "    words, and if so, we use `continue` to skip to the next line in the\n",
